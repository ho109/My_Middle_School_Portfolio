**Project Description**  

Started by analyzing the broad topic of **climate change**

â†’ Extracted key issues like **deforestation**, **carbon emissions**, **waste generation**

â†’ Chose **waste disposal** as the most relatable issue

> What is the core problem with waste disposal?

â†’ Recycling is not happening properly

> Why is recycling rate low?

â†’ Due to incorrect waste separation

â†’ Chose **incorrect waste separation** as the problem

Started as a SW/AI problem-solving school project under the theme of zero waste.  
From the broad topic of **climate change**, we extracted the issue of **improper waste separation**  
and decided to tackle it using **AI image recognition**.

- Recycling fails primarily due to incorrect waste sorting  
- To solve this, we built an **app that uses AI to recognize waste types**  
  and **suggests proper disposal methods**.

**Key Features**:  
- Provides disposal instructions by button click  
- AI auto-recognizes waste via camera and offers separation guidance  
- Intuitive UI improves accessibility  
- Designed for ease of use by students unfamiliar with recycling

### 2. School Lost-and-Found App

- **Period**: 2025.03.24 ~ 2025.04.11  
- **Role**: Full planning, design, frontend & backend development  
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting  
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Vive), JavaScript, Material Design UI, AI (Vive)  
  - **Backend**: Firebase Realtime DB or Firestore, JavaScript, Vive  

---

**Project Description**  
Submitted to the **46th Seoul Gangnam-Seocho Student Science Invention Contest**,  
this **digital lost-and-found management system** is a web-based app  
designed to help students easily find their lost items at school.

- Users choose from **floors 1â€“4** to register lost items  
- Inputs: Image and item name â†’ provides visual information  
- Features: Simple delete function for ease of management  
- Real-time sync: Firebase enables instant multi-device updates  
- UI/UX: Optimized layout and large buttons for accessibility  

This software-based app enables a practical shift  
from analog to digital systems, showing both innovation and usability.  
Assuming a management point per floor, users can check lost item locations  
without visiting the teacherâ€™s office, saving time and improving satisfaction.

> First time using **Vive** for UI design support.

This structure can be adapted for use in **libraries, public spaces, and more**  
as a general-purpose **digital asset management solution**.

---

**Reflections / Lessons Learned**  
- **Vive** helped build designs quickly  
- However, **debugging was difficult** and **creative control felt limited**,  
  so AI tools are best as assistants  
- Learned that **Firebase is easy to use**, but exposed API keys reminded me  
  to study **security practices** more (e.g., securing keys)  
- Developers should use tools wisely while **thinking critically and improving actively**

### 3. Turn-Based Combat Game

- **Period**: 2025.05.09 ~ 2025.05.19  
- **Role**: Full planning and design, all game logic and UI developed using AI  
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Vive), JavaScript, Canvas API  
  - **Game Structure**: VIVE coding environment + custom-made sprites (Piskel)  
  - **Image Assets**: Custom-edited pixel art monster sprites  

---

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project is a **turn-based combat game** implemented purely with JavaScript and Canvas API.  
The game is inspired by *Undertale* and features unique bullet patterns for each enemy.

- **Z Key**: Start attack gauge (closer to center = higher damage)  
- **X Key**: Use item (restore HP)  
- **C Key**: Sacrifice HP for a powerful attack  
- **P Key**: Manually change enemy (for debugging)  
- **Spacebar**: Restart game when over  
- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move and dodge  

> Each turn, enemies auto-execute a bullet pattern. Failing to dodge results in HP loss.  
> Defeating an enemy fully restores your HP for the next turn.  

---

**ðŸŽ® Enemy Patterns Summary**
- **Slime**: Bullets fired from the four corners  
- **Bat**: Side-firing horizontal projectiles  
- **Skeleton Archer**: Diagonal homing shots from top-right  
- **Skull**: Random vertical drops from above  
- **King Slime**: Bullets bounce off walls from center  
- **Robot**: Warns positions, then explodes in 8 directions  
- **Wizard..?**: Spiral-shaped bullet pattern  
- **Real Wizard**: 4-phase bullet attack (homing, delayed blast, etc.)  
- **Fire**: Rises from below and explodes at peak  
- **Goblin Shop**: Shop interface only â€” no combat  

---

**ðŸ“ˆ Difficulty System**
- **Easy**: Enemy HP/ATK Ã— 0.7  
- **Normal**: Ã— 0.9  
- **Hard**: Ã— 1.3  
- Difficulty is selected at the start screen, and UI language (Korean/English) adapts dynamically.

### ðŸ›  Development Log

- **5/9**: Got inspired by *Undertale* to make a pixel game  
  Originally wanted a 2-player action game with separate controls but gave up as it was too hard to beat

- **5/10**: Implemented movement and dodging with sway animation  
  Added more enemies (Goblin, Mage, etc.) instead of just Slime  
  Fixed bugs with item use and restarting via spacebar  

- **5/12**: Distributed to friends at school â€” feedback was positive, so continued development  
  Fixed minor bugs (e.g., Slime sprite being replaced by Bat)  

- **5/13**: Major code cleanup and refactoring  
  Portfolio and playtest planned, but monster images were broken  
  Replaced all sprites and adjusted code accordingly  
  Almost missed defining `drawUI`, which caused a big issue  

- **5/14**: GitHub upload attempt led to major issues  
  Created a new `game` folder and force-pushed over `pixel`, which broke everything  
  Spent the entire day recovering â€” risky but educational  

- **5/15**: Refined code and successfully uploaded to GitHub  
  Learned proper version control the hard way  

- **5/16**: Brought laptop to school camp trip but barely coded  

- **5/17**: Sleep-deprived from camp â€” made many bugs  

- **5/18**: Back on track  
  A dev-savvy friend discovered dev tools could bypass the game  
  Added a password system to lock dev tools behind the "O" key  
  Learned that I'll need obfuscation post-launch  

- **5/19**: Added difficulty levels and a title screen  
  (Easy: 0.7x, Normal: 0.9x, Hard: 1.3x enemy stats)  
  Fixed enemy HP initialization bug  
  Improved resolution and tweaked clarity (pixel blur added to keep the "gamey" feel)  
  Fixed Goblin Shop issue (didnâ€™t trigger due to being hardcoded in Korean only)  
  Finalized portfolio on GitHub  

---

**ðŸ’¬ Reflections**  
This took longer than expected.  
Originally just a quick 3-day project with ~500 lines of code to play with friends â€” turned into something much more.  
Still, every time someone gave feedback, it felt like solving a quest. That made it fun.  
This experience reinforced how vital **user communication** is when building games or services.

### 4. Element Absorption Pixel Game (Unity)

**Period**: 2025.06.02 ~ Ongoing  
**Role**: Planner, Programmer, Designer  
**Engine**: Unity 2D  
**Language**: C#  
**Tools**: Unity Editor, Sprite Editor, Piskel, VS code  
**Features**: Real-time element detection, texture color sampling, pixel-style visuals  

  
---

  
**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  

This is a 2D pixel-style exploration game where players absorb **elemental attributes** from colored tiles  
by pressing **Q** while standing on them. Absorbed elements are visually displayed next to the player.  
Each color corresponds to a unique element such as **Grass**, **Fire**, or **Poison**.  
This system will later influence **combat, synthesis**, and **environment interaction**.
