### About Me
>A simple introduction page about myself

Hello, I’m **Kim Hyojae**, Korean, 15, student at **Naegok Middle School**.

I have a strong interest in **IT** and **artificial intelligence** and am exploring new possibilities from a middle schooler’s perspective.

I am learning programming languages and coding tools such as **Python**, **Entry**, and **AI technologies**, and developing myself based on these skills.

In particular, I am a student developer with a passion for solving problems encountered in school life through coding and AI. I want to continue learning and growing in the fields of **AI** and **app development**.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Proper Waste Sorting Program

**Period**: 2024.10.15 ~ 2024.10.21  
**Role**: Project leader and software developer, responsible for AI image recognition training, and UI designer

**Technologies Used**:
- **AI Image Training**: Entry image training feature  
- **Frontend**: Entry’s built-in buttons and tools  
- **Backend**: Entry built-in features + additional functions  
- **Login System**: Entry’s data saving feature  

**Description**:  
Started by analyzing the broad topic of “climate change”

→ Extracted smaller keywords such as “deforestation,” “carbon emissions,” and “waste disposal”  
→ Chose “waste disposal” as the most relatable to daily life

**What is the core problem of waste disposal?**  
→ Recycling, a key solution, is not being properly implemented

**Why is recycling not working?**  
→ Due to incorrect waste sorting practices  
→ Chose “improper waste sorting” as the main problem

This project was a **Zero Waste** initiative developed for an **IT class** and submitted by our team **‘Hojae’**. It’s a system aimed at encouraging students and users to sort waste properly. Recommended for people who are unfamiliar with how to recycle correctly.

This app categorizes types of waste and informs the user how to sort each one properly.

If you want to sort plastic waste, simply press the **“Plastic Sorting Method”** button.  
If you don’t know what type of waste you’re dealing with, the **AI**—trained on image data—can recognize it through the camera and tell you the category and proper sorting method.

**Development Notes / Usage Highlights**:
- SW/AI problem-solving project started at school (10/10)
- Broke down the environmental issue and identified the core problem
- Created a paper prototype with pencil and paper, made a mockup video (10/15)
- Researched how Entry can help solve the issue and prepared the data (10/16)
- Discovered Entry’s object recognition feature and applied it (10/17)
- Collected ~100 images of waste categories from Kaggle and trained the model
- Reduced image data volume to prevent overload, focused on plastics, paper, and cans
- Created presentation materials in Canva and refined the app until presentation day (10/22)
- Simplified the UI after discussion with other students
- Presented in class and participated in group voting (10/29)
- Received high scores, presented in the school auditorium, and ranked among the top teams
