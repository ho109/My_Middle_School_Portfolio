## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Kim Hyojae**, a middle school student from South Korea.  

I’m deeply interested in **AI**, **software development**, and solving problems I face in daily school life using technology.  
Currently, I’m learning **Python**, **HTML**, **Java**, and **Entry** (a Korean visual coding platform),  
and constantly improving through hands-on projects.

## 💡 Projects



### 1. Lost & Found App for School  
**Period**: 2025.03.24 ~ 2025.04.11  
**Role**: Full-stack developer (planning, design, coding)  
**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material Design, Vive AI  
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime DB / Firestore  
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting  

**Overview**:  
Created for the **46th Seoul Gangnam-Seocho Student Science Invention Contest**,  
this web-based app helps students quickly locate lost items by floor using photos and item names.

**Key Features**:
- Floor-based item registration (1F to 4F)  
- Real-time synchronization with Firebase  
- Admin mode for easy item management  
- Accessible UI designed for students  

**Reflections**:
- Learned how AI (Vive) can help but also why balance is needed  
- Noted Firebase’s security issues (e.g. API key exposure)  
- Gained insight into scalable school-friendly app design
