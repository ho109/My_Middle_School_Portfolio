## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Kim Hyojae**, a middle school student from South Korea.  

I’m deeply interested in **AI**, **software development**, and solving problems I face in daily school life using technology.  
Currently, I’m learning **Python**, **HTML**, **Java**, and **Entry** (a Korean visual coding platform),  
and constantly improving through hands-on projects.

## 💡 Projects



### 1. Lost & Found App for School  
**Period**: 2025.03.24 ~ 2025.04.11  
**Role**: Full-stack developer (planning, design, coding)  
**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material Design, Vive AI  
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime DB / Firestore  
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting  

**Overview**:  
Created for the **46th Seoul Gangnam-Seocho Student Science Invention Contest**,  
this web-based app helps students quickly locate lost items by floor using photos and item names.

**Key Features**:
- Floor-based item registration (1F to 4F)  
- Real-time synchronization with Firebase  
- Admin mode for easy item management  
- Accessible UI designed for students  

**Reflections**:
-  Using **Vive** allowed me to work **faster and more easily**, especially with frontend design which usually takes more time.  
  However, I realized that relying too heavily on Vive for coding could cause problems like **difficulty in debugging**, **lack of creativity**, and **over-dependence on AI**.
-  I also learned that **Firebase**, while powerful, might not be the most **secure or efficient** in some cases.  
  **Exposing API keys** in admin mode made me reconsider using a different service in the future.
- Gained insight into scalable school-friendly app design

### 🛠 **Development Notes**

- Learned about the science invention contest at school (3/17)  
- Lost my padded jacket due to a poor lost & found system and barely retrieved it (3/19)  
- Received notice during science class to submit a project for the contest (3/25)  
- Decided to make an app based on my experience of losing an item, given my coding interest  
- Started development using Java and HTML, with AI suggestions (3/28)  
- Discovered that data wasn't saving properly  
- AI recommended using Firebase (3/29)  
- After getting approval to submit, focused on fixing bugs  
- Learned and applied Firebase functions with Java (4/1)  
- Implemented real-time sync with Firebase (4/2)  
- Once satisfied with the system, improved the interface and added documentation (4/3)  
- Designed a poster for school-wide distribution (4/10)  
- School is planning to adopt the system for real (4/14)

### 2. Proper Waste Sorting Program  
**Period**: 2024.10.15 ~ 2024.10.21  
**Role**: Project leader, AI trainer, developer  
**Platform**: Entry (block-based visual programming tool)  

**Overview**:  
Developed during a climate-focused IT project,  
this system identifies waste types using AI image recognition and guides users on proper sorting.

**Key Features**:
- Manual and AI-based waste identification  
- Focus on plastics, paper, and cans  
- Designed for students unfamiliar with recycling rules  

**Achievements**:
- Trained image model with Kaggle data (each 100~150 samples)  
- Top-ranked in school presentation vote  
- Created visuals and UI mockups using Canva
