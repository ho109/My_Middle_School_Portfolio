## 💡 Projects

### 1. Lost & Found App for School

**Period**: 2025.03.24 ~ 2025.04.11  
**Role**: Full-stack developer (planning, design, coding)  
**Tech Stack**:  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material Design, Vive AI  
- Backend: Firebase Realtime DB / Firestore  
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting

**Overview**:  
Developed for the 46th Seoul Gangnam-Seocho Student Science Invention Contest.  
Helps students locate lost items by floor with images and item names.

**Description**:  
- Register/view items by floor (1F~4F)  
- Real-time sync via Firebase  
- Accessible UI with large buttons  
- Shift from analog → digital lost & found system  
- Built using Vive AI for UI assistance  
- Expandable for libraries, public institutions, etc.

**Reflections**:  
- Vive AI improved speed but showed limitations in debugging/creativity  
- Firebase was useful but posed API key exposure risks  
- Learned value of balance between AI tools and developer independence

**Development Notes**:  
- 3/17: Learned about the contest  
- 3/19: Lost jacket → inspired the app idea  
- 3/25: Official project notice  
- 3/28: Started development (Java + HTML + AI help)  
- 3/29: Firebase suggested by AI  
- 4/01~04/03: Firebase integration, UI polish  
- 4/10: Created school poster  
- 4/14: School considering actual adoption

**Period**: 2024.10.15 ~ 2024.10.29  
**Role**: Team leader, AI trainer, developer  
**Platform**: Entry (block-based), Canva, Kaggle

**Overview**:  
Created for a school IT project on climate change.  
Uses AI to detect waste types and recommend correct disposal methods.

**Description**:  
- Button-based guide for known categories  
- AI camera for unknown waste detection  
- Focused on plastics, paper, cans  
- UI designed for ease of use

**Achievements**:  
- ~100 images per category trained with Kaggle data  
- Ranked top in school vote  
- Canva used for design and presentation

**Development Notes**:  
- 10/10: Project launched  
- 10/15: Paper prototype & mockup video  
- 10/16~17: Entry object recognition + AI training  
- 10/22: Final refinements  
- 10/29: School-wide presentation and recognition
