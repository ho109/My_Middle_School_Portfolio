## üìå About Me

Hello, I‚Äôm **Kim Hyojae**, a Korean student currently attending **Naegok Middle School**.  
I am highly interested in **IT**, **artificial intelligence**, and **app development**.  
From a middle school student‚Äôs perspective, I constantly explore how coding can solve real-life problems I encounter in school.  
I am currently learning and using **Python, HTML, Java, Entry**, and **AI technologies**, and I am growing through project-based learning.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. üîç Lost & Found App for School (2025)

- **Period**: 2025.03.24 ~ 2025.04.11  
- **Role**: Planned, designed, and developed both frontend and backend  
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting  
  - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material Design UI, AI (Vive)  
  - **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore, JavaScript  

**Overview**:  
Developed for the **46th Seoul Gangnam-Seocho Student Science Invention Contest**, this is a web-based **lost & found management app** for schools.  
Users can select floors (1st‚Äì4th), upload item photos, and register lost items with names. The system is synchronized in real-time using **Firebase**, ensuring compatibility with devices like Chromebooks.

**Key Features**:
- Visual upload & browsing by floor
- Simple management with add/delete functionality
- Scalable for libraries or public spaces
- Admin-side management for faster item return

**Reflections**:
- First time using **Vive AI** for frontend suggestions
- Learned importance of developer judgment over AI reliance
- Noted security limitations of Firebase (e.g., exposed API keys)

### 2. üöØ Proper Waste Sorting Program (2024)

- **Period**: 2024.10.15 ~ 2024.10.21  
- **Role**: Project leader, software developer, AI trainer, UI designer  
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **AI Training**: Entry image training feature  
  - **Frontend/Backend**: Entry's built-in features  
  - **Login System**: Entry's data-saving tool  

**Overview**:  
Created in response to climate change discussions in class.  
Identified **improper waste sorting** as a core issue in recycling and developed a solution that uses AI to identify waste categories and suggest proper disposal methods.

**Key Features**:
- User selects known category or uses AI camera to auto-detect waste
- Focused on plastics, paper, and cans
- UI/UX optimized based on peer feedback
- Designed a **Zero Waste** program usable by students

**Reflections**:
- Collected image data from **Kaggle**
- Presented in front of school, ranked as top team
- Used **Canva** for mockups and promotional materials

## üóÉ Learning Records

### Micro:bit Projects

- Implemented physical computing with servo motors, OLEDs, and LEDs  
- Learned linear regression modeling using Entry  
- Developed custom predictive algorithms and tested them  
- Used the **Biko** platform for modeling and visualization

### SFPC 2024 Participation

- Solved 8 out of 11 problems as a team  
- Ranked **119th** overall  
- Connected school APIs with Google Sheets for data visualization  
- Studied **computer system structures** and **data pipelines**

## üîß What is Entry?

**Entry** is a Korean visual programming platform similar to **Scratch**, widely used in schools for beginner-level coding education.  
It supports features such as:
- Block-based programming
- **AI model training** and **object recognition**
- Integration with hardware like **micro:bit**

Entry empowers students to create **interactive stories**, **games**, and **AI-based applications** while learning foundational software development skills.
