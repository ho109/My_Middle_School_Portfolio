## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Kim Hyojae**, a middle school student from South Korea.  
I'm interested in **AI**, **software development**, and enjoy building solutions to everyday problems—especially those I encounter at school.  
I’ve been learning **Python, HTML, Java, Entry**, and various **AI tools**, and I'm continually growing through hands-on projects.

## 💡 Projects

### 1. Lost & Found App for School (2025.03.24 ~ 2025.04.11)

**Role**: Full-stack developer (planned, designed, coded)  
**Tech Stack**:  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material Design, Vive AI  
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime DB / Firestore  
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting  

**Overview**:  
Created for the **46th Seoul Gangnam-Seocho Student Science Invention Contest**, this web-based app helps students locate lost items at school more efficiently.

**Key Features**:
- Upload and view lost items by floor (1F–4F)
- Real-time data sync via Firebase
- Admins can easily manage item listings
- Designed with accessibility and school usability in mind

**Reflections**:
- Vive AI accelerated UI design but taught me to avoid over-dependence
- Discovered Firebase limitations (e.g. API key exposure)
- Understood the balance between AI assistance and developer intuition

### 2. Proper Waste Sorting Program (2024.10.15 ~ 2024.10.21)

**Role**: Project leader, developer, AI trainer  
**Platform**: Entry (Korean block-based coding tool)  
**AI Tools**: Entry’s image training and object recognition  

**Overview**:  
Built during a climate-themed IT project. Tackled improper waste sorting by using AI to recognize waste types and provide correct recycling instructions.

**How it Works**:
- Users can manually select or use AI to detect the waste type
- Focused categories: plastics, paper, cans
- Designed for students unfamiliar with recycling rules

**Achievements**:
- Top-ranked team in class presentations
- Used Kaggle dataset to train AI model
- Created UI mockups and visuals with Canva

## 🛠 Learning Highlights

### Micro:bit Projects
- Used servo motors, OLED displays, LED I/O
- Built linear regression models using Entry
- Developed custom algorithms to predict and compare values

### SFPC 2024 Participation
- Solved 8 out of 11 problems (team score: 119th overall)
- Visualized API-connected school data in Google Sheets
- Studied basic computer system operations and logic
